# Create Implementation Plan

Read the current state of the project:
1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full system design
2. Read `docs/PLAN.md` for the current phase and status
3. Read `docs/DEVLOG.md` for recent context and decisions
4. Check open GitHub issues with `gh issue list`

Then, for the topic: $ARGUMENTS

1. Break it into discrete tasks (max 1-2 hours each)
2. Identify dependencies between tasks
3. For each task, note: what files are affected, what tests are needed
4. Create or update `docs/PLAN.md` with the new plan
5. Create GitHub issues for each task using `gh issue create`
6. Label issues appropriately (enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.)
7. Log this planning session in `docs/DEVLOG.md`
