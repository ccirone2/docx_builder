# This file is fetched by the workbook at startup to discover which document
# types are available. Each entry maps a schema ID to its YAML file and
# document template module.
#
# To add a new schema, append an entry here and add the corresponding
# .yaml and .py files to the schemas/ and templates/ directories.
